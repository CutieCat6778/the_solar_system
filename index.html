                    The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it,
                    either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight
                    planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
                    Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest
                    planet, Mercury.

                    The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring
                    systems. They are composed largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates—which form their
                    crusts and mantles—and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores.

                        Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other
                        planets. The smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 M⊕), Mercury has no natural satellites.
                        Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were
                        probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.

                        Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 M⊕) and, like Earth, has a thick
                        silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal
                        geological
                        activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no
                        natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F),
                        most
                        likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

                        hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
                        tectonics has been observed.

                        Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 M⊕). It has an atmosphere of
                        mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of
                        Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys,
                        such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as
                        2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil.

                <span>
                    The four outer planets, or giant planets (sometimes called Jovian planets), collectively make up 99%
                    of the mass known to orbit the Sun.[g] Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass
                    of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of the gases hydrogen and helium, hence their designation as gas
                    giants.

                        Jupiter (5.2 AU), at 318 M⊕, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. It is
                        composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent
                        features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 79 known
                        satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the
                        terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating.

                        Saturn (9.5 AU), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to
                        Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of
                        Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 M⊕. Saturn is the only planet of the
                        Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice
                        and rock particles. Saturn has 82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these,
                        Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity.

                        Uranus (19.2 AU), at 14 M⊕, is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it
                        orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much
                        colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus
                        has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.

                        dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14
                        known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid
                        nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is
                        accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1
                        resonance with it.
